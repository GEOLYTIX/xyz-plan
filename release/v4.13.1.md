# v4.13.1 🩹

v4.13.1 is coming off the back of some pretty massive front end changes that needed to be made in order to give the user a better experience.

Further CSS tweaks were needed in order to ensure that things translated for different themes that we want to implement in XYZ.
These theme changes go hand in hand with the darkmode plugin.

## What’s New 🚀

- **Insert Template Introduction:**
  We have now introduced a core template that can be used to insert into different layer tables.

- **Better Dataview developer experience**

## Improvements & Enhancements ✨

- **SMTP Server authentication changes:**
  You can now authenticate to an SMTP server with a username and not just an email address.

- **Fresh Look and Feel:**
  We’ve reviewed and updated our colour scheme, improved dark mode, and cleaned up icons and styles for a more polished appearance.

## Bug Fixes 🐛

- **More Reliable Dates:**
  Fixed an issue with date handling to ensure accuracy.

- **Other Minor Fixes:**
  Various behind-the-scenes fixes to keep things running smoothly.

## Technical Updates 📚

- **Performance and Code Quality:**
  We’ve made several improvements to the underlying code to make the app faster and more maintainable.
