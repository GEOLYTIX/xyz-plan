# v4.13.2 🩹

This release addresses a few important issues 🐛 and introduces a helpful new feature.

### SAML

We’ve fixed a problem with the SAML dependency logic that was affecting production environments.

### Dropdown

A major improvement in this version is the enhanced **Dropdown**:

You can now filter records within dropdown lists, making it much easier to find what you need—even in very large lists.

### Default Filter & Layer Defaults

We also resolved an issue where the locales layer was only merged when adding a new layer,
which meant the default settings weren’t always applied as expected.

This resulting in default filters on layers not being applied as expected.
