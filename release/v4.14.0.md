# v4.14.0 ðŸŒˆ

This is a small but useful minor release introducing two new features:

### XHR Abort Utility

A new utility to cancel outgoing requests that are made in quick succession, helping to prevent unnecessary network activity and improve performance.

### Email Filter Added

A default filter is now available to add an SQL filter statement for the `user.email` of the request.

```json
"filter": {
  "default": {
    "char_field": {
      "email": true
    }
  }
}
```
