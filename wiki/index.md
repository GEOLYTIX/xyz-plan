## XYZ/Mapp Wiki

The aim of this wiki is to provide an overview of the project and provide functional reference for developers and configurators.

[**XYZ**](https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/xyz/wiki/XYZ) is an API which can be deployed to any node runtime. The XYZ wiki page outlines the structure of API, its endpoints, node modules, and dependencies.

The [**Process Environment**](https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/xyz/wiki/environment) wiki page lists all environment variables which can be provided to the XYZ node process.

[**MAPP**](https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/xyz/wiki/MAPP) is a Javascript library which extends [Openlayers](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers) with Location, Layer, and Mapview interfaces. This wiki page outlines the structure of the MAPP API and serves as primary reference for all interface properties and methods.

[**MAPP UI**](https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/xyz/wiki/MAPP.UI) extends MAPP with custom elements to build map centric application views.

[**Workspaces**](https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/xyz/wiki/Workspace-Configuration) define the locales, layers, and locations available through a XYZ instance. The configuration page details the different sections of the workspace JSON document.

[**Application views**](https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/xyz/wiki/Application-Views) are web pages consisting of markup, script, the Openlayers, and MAPP libraries.

[**Plugins**](https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/xyz/wiki/Plugins) extend the core functionality of the MAPP and UI libraries.
