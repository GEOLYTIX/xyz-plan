# Layer

A JSON layer is a configuration object which can be added to a mapview. The MAPP library will decorate the JSON layer when it is added to the mapview to create a functional layer object which can be accessed through the mapview.layers list object.

## .template

The layer object will be merged into a template which matches the layer key. Alternatively a template can be referenced by the template property.

## .templates[]

Multiple templates can be assigned to the JSON layer. The Workspace API will merge these templates in order into the layer object.

**Please note the reversed order: The layer is merged into a template. But templates are merged into the layer.**

## .name

If not set the JSON layer key will be assigned as the layer's name. The name is assigned to the header of a layer view.

## .meta

The meta property value will be parsed as innerHTML for an element in the `layer.view` node.

## .group

Layer views will be grouped in a layer listview group drawer. The key-value of the `layer.group` property will be assigned as the group element header.

## .groupmeta

The `layer.groupmeta` property value will be parsed as innerHTML for an element in the `layer.group` node which contains the `layer.view` node.

## .display

The `layer.display` will determine whether the layer is displayed as default when added to a mapview without a layers URL parameter overriding which set of layers should be displayed.

## .hidden

The `layer.hidden` flag controls whether a layer view is created and shown in the layers listview. A layer without a view element is still accessible programatically through the `mapview.layers{}` object.

## .toggleLocationViewEdits

By default all location [infoj] entries with an edit key are editable. Setting the `layer.toggleLocationViewEdits` will prefix all edit entries with an underscore character. A spanner icon will be added to the `location.view` header to toggle the edit entries.

## .qID

Requests to the Location API require the field name for a unique location identifier.

## .table

The table name for the layer data at rest.

## .tables{}

Instead of the `layer.table` a `layer.tables{}` configuration object can be assigned to the JSON layer. The keys in the tables object representing an integer zoom level. The key-value is the table name for the keyed zoom level. A `null` value as the smallest or largest zoom key-value will make the layer unavailable at or beyond that zoom level. Without a null value the last defined table name in the tables object will be used.

```js
{
  7: null,
  8: "schema.table_1",
  9: "schema.table_2",
  10: "schema.table_3",
  11: null
}
```

## .geom

The field name which stores the feature geometries in the layer table.

## .geoms{}

Instead of the `layer.geom` a `layer.geoms{}` configuration object can be assigned to the JSON layer. The keys in the geoms object representing an integer zoom level. The key-value being is the feature geometry field name for the keyed zoom level. The smallest or largest zoom level key-value will be assigned as geometry field in requests which are outside the specified zoom level range.

```js
{
  8: "geom_50m",
  9: "geom_10m",
  10: "geom"
}
```

## .z_field [filter]

Features will be filtered if the `.z_field` integer value is below the current zoom level.

```json
"z_field": "field"
```

## .srid

The SRID/EPSG projection code for the layer geometry field.

## .[custom]{} layer plugin

Any layer keys are checked against the `mapp.plugins{}` and `mapp.layer{}` methods when a layer is decorated. The decorated layer object which must have a mapview property is provided as only argument to the plugin/layer method.

## .deleteLocation

The `deleteLocation: true` flag indicates whether a location can be deleted from the layer's dataset.

## .queryparams{}

The `layer.queryparams` will be used assigned to layer queries and to location `entry.queryparams{}`. The `locale.queryparams{}` will be assigned to the `layer.queryparams{}`.

## .panelOrder[]

The order of layer panel in the layer view can be controlled with the `.panelOrder[]` array.

The default order is:

```js
.panelOrder: [
  'draw-drawer',
  'dataviews-drawer',
  'filter-drawer',
  'style-drawer',
  'meta'
]
```

# Location

A location is associated with the features that make up a layer. It is possible to get a location from the XYZ Location API by sending a request providing the `locale`, `layer`, and a location's unique ID.

## .infoj_skip[]

The infoj_skip array allows you to define a list of keys, fields, or queries to be skipped from the infoj of that layer.

```json
"infoj_skip": [
  "field_to_skip",
  "key_to_skip",
  "query_to_skip"
]
```

## .infoj_order[]

The infoj_order array can be defined as a list of lookup keys and entry objects.

```json
"infoj_order": [
  {
    "type": "dataview",
    "dataview": "tabulator",
    "target": "tabview",
    "query": "query_template",
    "table": {
      "layout": "fitColumns",
      "columns": [],
      "autoColumns": true
    }
  },
  "entry_key",
  "char_field",
  "textarea"
]
```

Key strings will be used to lookup entries in the location layer infoj array for matching key, field, or query key values. This allows for the sorting and filtering of infoj entries.

Entry objects in the infoj_order will be spliced and decorated with the location object in place.

## .infoj[entry]

The infoj is the term used to describe the information we provide in the left-hand panel of the map window when you click on a geometry. This is an array of objects that make up what the user wishes to see.

### .field

### .fieldfx

Fieldfx allows you to alter the value displayed in the infoj. This is particularly useful if you wish to apply formatting to a number, convert values or change the field `"ROUND(numeric_value,2)"`. This can be provided as an SQL query, but must all be provided on a single line. If you wish to provide an SQL query, you must ensure the `WHERE` clause includes `WHERE id= $1`.

```SQL
SELECT ROUND(numeric_value2,2) FROM table_2 LEFT JOIN table_1 ON t1.id = t2.id WHERE id=$1
```

It is possible to query a json field key through the fieldfx using the json arrow notatrion. The following fieldfx will return the 'age' value from the json_field column.

```json
"fieldfx": "json_field -> 'age'",
```

### .jsonb_field / .jsonb_key

Using a combination of jsonb_field and jsonb_key allows to update individual key values in a json type column.

The following example uses the json arrow notation to extract the age value from the json_field. The `field` value must be unique in order to assign the value from the get location request to the correct entry.

```json
{
  "field": "json_field_age",
  "fieldfx": "json_field -> 'age'",
  "jsonb_field": "json_field",
  "jsonb_key": "age",
  "edit": true
}
```

### .json_field / .json_key

The combination of of json_field and json_key may be used to create editable entries for a single json key/value.

A type:json entry must be added to the infoj array. The `json_field` value will be used as lookup to identify the entry with the matching field value.

The location.update method will update the key/value in the json entry before updating the object in the location data at rest.

```json
{
  "field": "json_field",
  "type": "json",
  "skipEntry: true
},
{
  "json_field": "json_field",
  "json_key": "age",
  "edit": true
}
```

### .query

The query template to use for a query which will populate the `entry.value`

#### .queryparams{}

The queryparams are used to create the url params for a request to the Query API. The `layer.queryparams{}`, and `locale.queryparams{}` will be assigned to the `entry.queryparams{}`.

The following queryparams flags are reserved.

```js
"queryparams": {
  "locale": true, // locale key.
  "layer": true, // layer key.
  "table": true, // layer table.
  "filter": true, // layer current filter.
  "z": true, // mapview current z.
  "viewport": true, // mapview [west,south,east,north] bounds.
  "center": true, // mapview lat/lng center.
  "email": true, // user email.
}
```

#### .run / .queryCheck

A query will be run by the infoj process and the response will be assigned as `entry.value` before the `entry.type` method is called.

### .value

The `entry.value` will be populated from the field or fieldfx value in location get response, or from a `entry.query` response.

### .title

The value to be rendered into the title element which is appended to the entry.node.

### .css_title

The `entry.css_title` value will be applied as inline style to the title element inside the entry.node.

### .css_val

The `entry.css_val` value will be applied as inline style to the value element inside the entry.node.

### .tooltip

The value to show as a tooltip when hovering over the title.<br>This will also append an SVG of a question mark to the end of the title so the user is aware that it has a tooltip.

### .inline

The value element will be displayed in a separate row below the title element. If `entry.inline: true` the title and value will be rendered in the same row in the location view entry.node.

### .prefix

Prefix allows you to add a prefix to the start of the field value in the infoj. This is useful if you are displaying currencies.
`prefix: 'Â£' `

### .suffix

Suffix allows you to add a suffix to the end of the field value in the infoj. This is useful if you are displaying percentages.
`suffix: '%' `

### .group

You can put infoj objects into a group to help break up the information. You must provide a group name to do this, which will be displayed above the first infoj object with that group associated to it.

#### .groupClassList

The group drawer will be expanded if any of the entries which are added to a location view group have the `.groupClassList: "expanded"` flag set.
(Note: `.expanded: true` is deprecated)

### .objectMergeFromEntry

The `.objectMergeFromEntry` value can be used to look up an entry with matching type. The lookup entry will be merged into the entry.

```json
{
  "title": "Merge into this entry",
  "objectMergeFromEntry": "mergeEntry"
},
{
  "type": "mergeEntry"
  "title": "This title will overwrite the original entry title."
}
```

### .class

The `entry.class` value will be concatenated as class[List] property for the creation of the `entry.node` element. Assigning the `display-none` class prevent the entry.node from being displayed.

### .nullValue

If configured `null` will be replaced as `entry.value` with the `entry.nullValue`.

### .skipEntry

The entry will not be processed by the infoj method if flagged as true.

### .skipNullValue

The entry will not be processed by the infoj method if the entry value is null (`entry.value === null`).

### .skipFalsyValue

The entry will not be processed by the infoj method if the entry.value is falsy, e.g. undefined, null ,NaN ,0 ,"" (`!entry.value`).

### .skipUndefinedValue

The entry will not be processed by the infoj method if the entry.value is undefined (`typeof entry.value === 'undefined'`).

### .filter

If a filter is taking a long time to load on the MAPP instance and it is a numeric or integer field - apply the max and min settings and make sure to apply an index to that field on the table on the database.

#### Numeric

Creates a slider bar and manual input box to filter numeric values that are greater than and less than the provided values.

- For numeric filters specifying the min and max makes the filter query faster as it saves two calculations on the data.
- Although min and max are not a requirement for `field` definitions there are mandatory for `fieldfx` definitions.
- Uses the numeric formatting of the `infoj` entry that the filter is applied to.

```json
"filter": {
        "type": "numeric",
        "min": 123.45678,
        "max": 123456.78
      }
```

#### Integer

Creates a slider bar and manual input box to filter integer values that are greater than and less than the provided values.

- For numeric filters specifying the min and max makes the filter query faster as it saves two calculations on the data.
- Although min and max are not a requirement for `field` definitions there are mandatory for `fieldfx` definitions.
- Uses the numeric formatting of the `infoj` entry that the filter is applied to.

```json
"filter": {
        "type": "integer",
        "min": 123,
        "max": 123456
      }
```

#### Match

Creates a free text box that will filter on exactly what is provided in the text box with the database field value.
<br>By default this will search for your search term only `search_term`.
<br> To search for the search term and anything before it, add `leading_wildcard: true`. This will search for `%search_term`.

```json
"filter": {
        "type": "match"
      }
```

#### Like

Creates a free text box that will filter the database field value where the value contains the data provided in the free text box.
<br>By default this will search for your search term and a wildcard for anything following it `search_term%`.
<br> To search for the search term anywhere in the field, add `leading_wildcard: true`. This will search for `%search_term%`.

```json
"filter": {
        "type": "like"
      }
```

#### in [array]

An `in[]` of filter values can be configured. A distinct values query will be used without an array of filter values.
A `entry.field` is required for layer filter.
Returns a list of checkboxes by default to toggle the individual in [array] values.
Can be defined as `dropdown` or `searchbox` UI filter elements.

```json
"field": "table_column",
"filter": {
  "type": "in",
  "in": ["A", 1, "Foo"],
  "dropdown": true
}
```

#### ni [not in]

An `ni[]` of filter values can be configured. A distinct values query will be used without an array of filter values.
A `entry.field` is required for layer filter.
Returns a list of checkboxes by default to toggle the individual in [array] values.
Can be defined as `dropdown` or `searchbox` UI filter elements.

```json
"field": "table_column",
"filter": {
  "type": "ni",
  "ni": ["A", 1, "Foo"],
  "searchbox": true
}
```

#### Datetime

Provides a filter using a calendar which includes both the date calendar and date time.

```json
"filter": {
        "type": "datetime"
      }
```

### .objectAssignFromField

This allows you to use a query to build a json_object that can then be passed into an object in the `infoj`.

This is particularly useful if you wish to define the title using values that may change (ie you wish to display the year from a year field that can be updated).

Here, you first create an `infoj` object to define the title, and set it to display-none (so the user cannot see). This `infoj` object will have a fieldfx to create the json object.

Then, you create a second `infoj` object for the field value (perhaps a count for a year), and assign the objectAssignFromField to this.

This will then assign your title object to the `infoj` object.

If you wish to use the field from this within a filter you will need to provide a label for the filter within the filter block.

```json
{
  "field": "pass_yr_minus_1_title",
  "fieldfx": "json_build_object('title',  concat(('April ',(current_year - 2)))",
  "type": "json",
  "class": "display-none"
},
{
  "field": "pass_yr_minus_1",
  "objectAssignFromField": "pass_yr_minus_1_title",
  "type": "integer",
  "inline": true,
  "filter": {
    "title": "Passengers (past year)",
    "type": "numeric"
  }
}
```

### .type:"[custom]"{} location entry plugin

A plugin may add a custom entry method to `mapp.ui.locations.entries{}`. These entry methods behave the same as any entry method and will receive the entry itself as only argument. The location, layer, and mapview can all be inferred from the entry object.

#### key

The `type: key` entry will be displayed by the layer name in the location view.

```json
{
  "type": "key"
}
```

#### pin

The `type: pin` entry will create a labelled and coloured pin for the location. The value must resolve to a coordinate array matching the entry srid. The layer.srid is assumed as the default.

```json
{
  "type": "pin",
  "field": "pin",
  "fieldfx": "ARRAY[ST_X(geom_p_4326), ST_Y(geom_p_4326)]"
}
```

#### text

The `type:text` is the default entry type which will be assigned if not implicit. The edit config supports a placeholder for the input element and to define the maxlength for the input.

```json
"type": "text",
"edit": {
  "placeholder": "Input placeholder text",
  "maxlength": 7
}
```

#### textarea

The `type:textarea` will provid a multiline textarea input for editing. The edit config supports a placeholder for the input element and to define the maxlength for the input.

```json
"type": "textarea",
"edit": {
  "placeholder": "Input placeholder text",
  "maxlength": 7
}
```

#### integer

The `type: integer` entry will parse the value as an integer.

```json
{
  "field": "field_name",
  "type": "integer"
}
```

#### numeric

The `type: numeric` will parse the value as a float. A `formatterParams` object can be provided to configure a `toLocaleString` conversion of the value for display.

Typically this will just want to be `maximumFractiondigits` which is the number of decimal places.

Further options can be found [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString), by default the locale is set to `en-GB`

```json
{
  "field": "field_name",
  "type": "numeric",
  "formatterParams": {
    "options": {
      "maximumFractionDigits": 5
    },
    "locale": "en-GB"
  }
}
```

`rounnd:int` can be used as a shorthand for `formatterParams.options.maximumFractionDigits`

```json
{
  "field": "field_name",
  "type": "numeric",
  "round": 1
}
```

#### date

`type: date` Adds a date `infoj` entry.

Database field must be of type bigint.

By default this will show as dd/mm/yyyy, hh:mm:ss.<br> To return just the date in format dd/mm/yyyy add the `locale` and `options` object.

```json
{
  "field": "date",
  "type": "date",
  "locale": "en-UK",
  "options": {
    "year": "numeric",
    "month": "2-digit",
    "day": "2-digit"
  }
}
```

#### datetime

`type: datetime` Adds a datetime `infoj` entry.

Database field must be of type bigint.

By default this will show as dd/mm/yyyy, hh:mm:ss.<br>You can control this with the `locale` and `options` object.

```json
{
  "field": "date",
  "type": "datetime",
  "locale": "en-UK",
  "options": {
    "year": "numeric",
    "month": "2-digit",
    "day": "2-digit"
  }
}
```

#### time

`type: time` Adds a time`infoj` entry.

Database field must be of type numeric or varchar.

```json
{
  "title": "Time",
  "field": "time_field",
  "type": "time"
}
```

#### link

The `type:link` entry will create a node containing an icon and anchor tag (link). The default icon class is `mask-icon open-in-new`. The default label for the link is "Link". An URL path must be defined as `entry.url`. The URL parameter are constructed from the params object.
The icon style can be set as inline style provided as `icon_style` string value.

```json
{
  "type": "link",
  "icon_class": "mask-icon open-in-new",
  "label": "Link",
  "url": "https://geolytix.com",
  "params": {
    "param": "value"
  }
}
```

#### query_button

Creates a button element in the location view which run a parameterised query. The `host`, `query`[template] and `queryparams` can be configured in the entry.

An array of dependents [fields] can be defined. The matching entry values will be synched after the query has been resolved.

```json
{
  "label": "Snap to Postal Sector",
  "type": "query_button",
  "query": "catchment_statistics_snap_to_postal_sector",
  "queryparams": {
    "id": true
  },
  "alert": "Query has executed!",
  "reload": true,
  "dependents": ["geom_3857", "perimeter", "area"]
}
```

#### report [legacy]

The `type:report` entry is a legacy configuration that will resolve without warning to a `type:link`.

#### html

`type: html` This will allow you to output HTML directly into the infoj field. <br>This is useful as we can use this to control colouring, and text-formatting of information in the infoj for that field.

```json
{
  "field": "field_name",
  "type": "html",
  "fieldfx": "CONCAT('<a href=',field,'>Hyperlink</a></span>')"
}
```

#### title

`type: title` This will allow you to just define a title as that infoj entry.<br>There is an optional `css_title` key that can be used to control the styling of the title.

```json
{
  "type": "title",
  "title": "This is a title",
  "css_title": "font-weight:400"
}
```

#### json

The `type:json` entry value is a json object. The SQL field must be type json to support a json entry. The edit interface will attempt to parse a json object before allowing to store a new value in the location data at rest. `.json_field` with `.json_key` entries can be used to update individual key/values in the json field.

```json
{
  "field": "json_field",
  "type": "json",
  "edit: true
}
```

#### pills

The `type:pills` entry value requires an array value. The array values will be displayed as pills.

```json
{
  "field": "arr_field",
  "type": "pills"
}
```

#### image

The `type:image` entry will show a thumbnail of an image from a cloudinary url stored as the entry.field value. If editable it is possible to delete the image or upload an image if the value is null.

A `cloudinary_folder` must be provided to determine the location where the images are stored.

```json
{
  "field": "field_name",
  "type": "image",
  "cloudinary_folder": "folder_name",
  "edit": true
}
```

A valid `CLOUDINARY_URL` must be in the process env in order to upload or remove images.

#### images

The `type:images` entry will be displayed as a gallery of thumbnails in the location view. The thumbnails can be previewed by clicking. An interface to upload or delete images is available with the `entry.edit:true` flag.

A `cloudinary_folder` must be provided to determine the location where the images are stored.

```json
{
  "field": "field_name",
  "type": "images",
  "cloudinary_folder": "folder_name",
  "edit": true
}
```

The field to store references for cloudinary resources must be defined as a text array in the layer table.

```sql
images text[] DEFAULT '{}'::text[]
```

A valid `CLOUDINARY_URL` must be in the process env in order to upload or remove images.

#### dataview

The `type: dataview` allow output to a chart or table to the infoj, tabview or a HTML location within a custom view (report).

##### Table Infoj Dataview

A Table Dataview returns a table. This uses the [Tabulator Package](http://tabulator.info/docs/5.4/format) to do so, please refer to the documentation for table formatting options.<br> Further Dataview Functionality may be present in the [Dataview Section](https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/xyz/wiki/Configuration#layer-dataview).

```json
{
  "label": "Table Infoj Dataview",
  "type": "dataview",
  "target": "location",
  "query": "query_name",
  "queryparams": {
    "id": true,
    "table": true,
    "filter": true
  },
  "table": {
    "layout": "fitColumns",
    "columns": [
      {
        "title": "Field",
        "field": "field"
      },
      {
        "title": "Value",
        "field": "value",
        "formatter": "toLocaleString"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Here we can provide:

- `label`(optional) - This generates a checkbox with the name in the infoj, without the label the dataview cannot be toggled on/off.
- `target` - This can be tabview (the tab at the bottom of the MAPP), location (the infoj), or a HTML location ('html-dataview'). <br> The HTML location is used when we wish to draw a chart directly into a report.
- `SkipEntry: true`(optional) - This is used when we wish to skip the drawing of the chart, this is used when we want to draw a dataview to a HTML location within a report.
- `queryCheck: true`(optional) - This will check whether the query for the dataview returns data, and if not will disable the checkbox if one is provided, or hide the dataview from display.
- `display: true`(optional) - This will set the dataview to automatically display, the default is false.
- `queryparams` - This provides the parameters you wish to pass to a query.
  <br> This is typically `id: true` to select just information for a particular location.
  <br> You can also provide `table: true` which will provide the table defined on the layer. This is especially useful when using a template but defining the table for each locale within the layer.json. <br> This requires the SQL query to contain `FROM ${table}` to ensure it only returns information from the relevant table location.
  <br> You can provide `filter: true` which will pass the filters selected on the layer to the query. This requires `WHERE true ${filter}` to be added to the query.
- `formatter: toLocaleString`- This will add thousand separators to the number (1000 becomes 1,000).

##### Chart Infoj Dataview

A Chart Dataview returns a chart. This uses the [ChartJS Package](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) to do so, please refer to the documentation for chart formatting options.<br> Further Dataview Functionality may be present in the [Dataview Section](https://github.com/GEOLYTIX/xyz/wiki/Configuration#layer-dataview).

```json
{
  "label": "Chart Infoj Dataview",
  "type": "dataview",
  "display": false,
  "target": "location",
  "query": "query_name",
  "queryparams": {
    "id": true,
    "table": true,
    "filter": true
  },
  "chart": {
    "options": {
      "aspectRatio": 1.4,
      "indexAxis": "x"
    }
  }
}
```

Here we can provide:

- `label`(optional) - This generates a checkbox with the name in the infoj, without the label the dataview cannot be toggled on/off.
- `target` - This can be tabview (the tab at the bottom of the MAPP), location (the infoj), or a HTML location ('html-dataview'). <br> The HTML location is used when we wish to draw a chart directly into a report.
- `SkipEntry: true`(optional) - This is used when we wish to skip the drawing of the chart, this is used when we want to draw a dataview to a HTML location within a report.
- `queryCheck: true`(optional) - This will check whether the query for the dataview returns data, and if not will disable the checkbox if one is provided, or hide the dataview from display.
- `display: true`(optional) - This will set the dataview to automatically display, the default is false.
- `queryparams` - This provides the parameters you wish to pass to a query.
  <br> This is typically `id: true` to select just information for a particular location.
  <br> You can also provide `table: true` which will provide the table defined on the layer. This is especially useful when using a template but defining the table for each locale within the layer.json. <br> This requires the SQL query to contain `FROM ${table}` to ensure it only returns information from the relevant table location.
  <br> You can provide `filter: true` which will pass the filters selected on the layer to the query. This requires `WHERE true ${filter}` to be added to the query.

#### geometry

The type `type:geometry` field value must be geojson. The geometry will be added to the mapview with the provided style. The location style will be assigned to the entry.style. The `location.layer.srid` will be assumed as projection if not implicit as `entry.srid`. A fieldfx function can be used to generate the required format in the location.get() request.

A draw config block can be defined in the entry root or within the edit block. Drawing will always be available if defined on the root or can be toggled with editing if defined in the edit block.

The entry will be skipped with the `hideNoEdit` flag set and editing disabled.

```json
{
  "label": "Label",
  "field": "field_name",
  "srid": "4326",
  "fieldfx": "ST_asGeoJson(geom_4326)",
  "type": "geometry",
  "style": {
    "strokeColor": "#e65100",
    "fillColor": "#e65100",
    "strokeWidth": 2,
    "fillOpacity": 0.2
  },
  "dependents": ["pin"],
  "hideNoEdit": true,
  "edit": {
    "modify_label": "Move Site",
    "delete_label": "Delete Geometry"
    },
    "draw": {
      "polygon": true,
    }
  }
}
```

#### MVT Clone

`type: mvt_clone` allows you to create an infoj object from a different `format: mvt` layer.
<br>To use this, you must have a `layer.json` in the `workspace.json` that you wish to copy the thematic from.
<br>This infoj object will then create a tickbox and the thematic from the other `layer.json` when you select the location.

- `zIndex` (optional) - This allows control of the order of drawing. If the `zIndex` for the `type: mvt_clone` is higher than for the geometries on the location, then the `type:mvt_clone` thematic will be drawn on top.
- `display` (optional) - When set to `true` the thematic will load automatically when you click on a location.
- `layer` - This is the layer that you wish to clone the thematic from.
- `label` - This is the label associated with the checkbox in the infoj.
- `query` - This is a query to select only the relevant geometries from the same table as is used in the layer to clone. <br> For instance if you click on a polygon and want to clone the thematic for hexagons that have a polygon_id associated to them, the query would be `SELECT hexagons FROM table WHERE polygon_id=%{id}`.
- `queryparams` - This is the parameters for the query.
- `style` - If left off will default to the style from the layer you are cloning from, otherwise will use the style provided.

```json
{
  "type": "mvt_clone",
  "zIndex": 99,
  "display": true,
  "layer": "footfall_2021",
  "label": "Footfall Count",
  "query": "footfall_rp",
  "queryparams": {
    "id": true
  },
  "style": {
    "theme": {
      "type": "graduated",
      "field": "glx_ff_21",
      "cat_arr": [
        {
          "value": "0",
          "label": "0 - 5,000",
          "style": {
            "fillColor": "#8BB9E4"
          }
        },
        {
          "value": "5000",
          "label": "5,000 - 25,000",
          "style": {
            "fillColor": "#a1ccbd"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Vector Layer

`type: vector_layer` allows you to create an infoj object from a query (this is the equivalent of `mvt_clone` but for point data).
<br>This infoj object will then create a tickbox and when checked will draw the points to the mapview.
<br>You can apply thematic styling to this layer and use labels as you can with other layer formats.

- `zIndex` (optional) - This allows control of the order of drawing.
- `display` (optional) - When set to `true` the points will load automatically when you click on a location.
- `label` - This is the label associated with the checkbox in the `infoj`.
- `query` - This is a query to select only the relevant geometries.
  <br>This requires a particular format as it cannot be a `src` but must be a `template`
  <br>NOTE - You need to return the geometry in the correct format for that layer type. e.g. `wkt` requires `ST_AsText(geom)`.

```json
"query_vector": {
     "template": "SELECT ST_AsText(geom_p_4326), thematic_field, thematic_label FROM table WHERE site_id=%{id}"
}
```

- `queryparams` - This is the parameters for the query.
  <br>You MUST pass `reduce:true` to the queryparameters.
- `style` - The style for the points.
  <br>Note, to use `label` and `theme/themes` you must pass `params.fields` array containing the `fields` used.

```json
{
  "label": "Label",
  "type": "vector_layer",
  "format": "wkt",
  "srid": "4326",
  "display": true,
  "query": "query_vector",
  "queryparams": {
    "id": true,
    "reduce": true
  },
  "params": {
    "fields": ["thematic_field", "thematic_label"]
  },
  "style": {
    "default": {
      "icon": {
        "type": "dot",
        "fillColor": "#f2fc"
      }
    },
    "label": {
      "field": "thematic_label",
      "title": "Label"
    },
    "theme": {
      "title": "Thematic",
      "type": "graduated",
      "field": "thematic_field",
      "cat_arr": [
        {
          "value": 0,
          "label": "0 to 500",
          "style": {
            "fillColor": "#f7fcf5",
            "fillOpacity": 0.5
          }
        },
        {
          "value": 500,
          "label": "500 to 750",
          "style": {
            "fillColor": "#e5f5e0",
            "fillOpacity": 0.5
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### .edit{}

Editing is possible on locations, so the user could for instance alter a field name, add a comment or move a geometry and this would be stored to the database.

Adding `toggleLocationViewEdits: true` will add a spanner to the location entry that can be toggled for editing.

This is particularly useful if any of your fields use formatting or `fieldfx`.

This should be used as the default as it is much neater for the user.

It is also possible to edit field values within a location, and save these to the database.

```json
"edit": true
```

#### .placeholder

If configured a placeholder will be set on the edit input element where available (eg. text, textarea, options)

```json
"edit": {
  "placeholder": "Select from list",
  "options": ["A", "B"]
}
```

#### Options

Three options here:

1. Provide defined options

```json
"edit": {
 "options": ["A", "B"]
}
```

2. Provide empty options array
   <br>This will then use the `distinct_values` template to get all values from the field on the table as provide them.

```json
"edit": {
 "options": []
}
```

3. Provide query
   <br>This will then run the provided query to get the values for the options.<br>This query must in the `workspace.templates` object.

```json
"edit": {
 "query": "edit_options",
 "options": []
}
```

#### Modifying Geometry

If you wish to edit geometry, then we must specify this in the `edit` object.

```json
  "infoj": [
     {
      "type": "geometry",
      "display": true,
      "field": "geom_p_4326",
      "fieldfx": "ST_asGeoJSON(geom_p_4326)",
      "edit": {
        "geometry": true
      }
    }
  ]
```

##### delete_label

- Providing an `edit.delete_label` will provide a custom label to the 'Delete Geometry' button.

```json
"edit": {
    "geometry": true,
    "delete_label": "Delete Site Geometry"
}
```

##### modify_label

- Providing an `edit.modify_label` will provide a custom label to the 'Modify Geometry' button.

```json
"edit": {
    "geometry": true,
    "modify_label": "Move Site"
}
```

### .dependents

Dependents allow us to set certain fields to be updated when another is edited.
<br>For instance, if the user can edit `type: geometry` we may wish to set the `type: pin` as a dependent, so that the pin is always shown in the correct location.
<br> We also set `dependents` on a field that is not editable by the user, but will be edited via a trigger on the database side.
<br>Here you can provide an array of `field` values that you wish to reload upon changes to the field in question.

```json
   {
      "type": "geometry",
      "display": true,
      "field": "geom_p_4326",
      "fieldfx": "ST_asGeoJSON(geom_p_4326)",
      "dependents": ["pin","field_1","field_2"],
      "edit": {
        "geometry": true
      }
    },
```

# Dataviews

A Layer Dataview (chart or table) is linked to a particular layer. Here the query used to create the dataview would likely select all rows from the table associated with the layer.

These Layer Dataviews are created within the `dataviews` object in the `layer.json` file.

## Table [dataview]

A Table Dataview returns a table to the `tabview`. This uses the [Tabulator Package](http://tabulator.info/docs/5.4/format) to do so, please refer to the documentation for table formatting options.

```json
"dataview_key": {
  "target": "tabview",
  "display": true,
  "query": "query_name",
  "placeholder": "No Data Available",
  "queryparams": {
    "table": true,
    "filter": true
  },
  "viewport": true,
  "mapChange": true,
  "events": {
    "rowClick": {
      "util": "select",
      "layer": "uk_health",
      "zoomToLocation": true
    },
    "rowDblClick": {
      "util": "select",
      "zoomToLocation": true
    }
  },
  "table": {
    "selectable": true,
    "layout": "fitColumns",
    "columns": [
      {
        "title": "Field",
        "field": "field",
        "headerSort": false
      },
      {
        "title": "Count",
        "field": "value",
        "headerSort": false,
        "formatter": "toLocaleString"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Here we can provide:

- `Dataview Name` - This generates a checkbox with the name provided in the Dataviews pane of the layer.
- `target: tabview` - This generates the dataview in the bar on the bottom of the MAPP window.
- `display: true`(optional) - This generates the dataview and but hides it from display. By default this is `false`.
- `placeholder`(optional) - This will display the text string to the user when no data is returned.
- `selectable: true`(optional) - This will allow the rows to be highlighted on hover <br> This must be provided inside the `tables` object, and the query used must return an id column.
- `selectable: true` must also be paired with the `events` object.
- `events` - This allows you to provide any Tabulator event and a function to run when that event occurs.
  <br> Typically we would want to provide `rowClick: select` which would perform a function on a single click.
  <br> If we wish to return a location from a different layer (cross-layer selection), then within the event we need to provide the key of that layer (uk_health in the example above), otherwise it will just return the location within the current layer.
  <br> We can also provide on double click to select and also zoom to that location.
- `viewport: true`(optional) - This will only return locations within the viewport (the map window) display. <br> The query must contain `WHERE true ${viewport}' for this to work.
- `mapChange: true`(optional) - This will refresh the dataview each time you stop zooming or panning in the map display display.
- `queryparams` - This provides the parameters you wish to pass to a query.
  <br> You can provide `table: true` which will provide the table defined on the layer. This is especially useful when using a template but defining the table for each locale within the layer.json. <br> This requires the SQL query to contain `FROM ${table}` to ensure it only returns information from the relevant table location.
  <br> You can provide `filter: true` which will pass the filters selected on the layer to the query. This requires `WHERE true ${filter}` to be added to the query.
  <br>But can provide whatever we want, perhaps a `table` or `filter: true` to ensure all filters are applied to the dataview.
- `formatter: toLocaleString`- This will add thousand separators to the number (1000 becomes 1,000).

### HeaderFilters

headerFilters are provided to allow the user to filter the information in the Tabulator tables.
<br> We have 3 headerFilters:

- `set`
- `numeric`
- `like`
- `date`

#### Set

This returns a dropdown with multiple options of which any number can be selected.

```json
{
  "title": "Field",
  "field": "field",
  "headerFilter": "set",
  "headerFilterParams": {
    "placeholder": "Select to Remove",
    "distinct": true,
    "layerFilter": true,
    "type": "ni"
  }
}
```

The headerFilterParams allow you to provide:

- A placeholder that is used on the dropdown on initial load.
- `distinct: true` which will return all values in that field on the database.
- You may also provide `options: ["A", "B"]` instead of `distinct:true`.
- `layerFilter: true` which will update the map with the filters applied within the table.
- `type: ni` which will remove from the table those values selected. The default is `type: in`.

#### Numeric

This returns two input boxes Min and Max for numeric filtering.

```json
{
  "title": "Field",
  "field": "numeric_field",
  "headerFilter": "numeric"
}
```

#### Like

This returns a free text box for filtering.

```json
{
  "title": "Field",
  "field": "field",
  "headerFilter": "like"
}
```

#### Date

The field to use this on must be of type `bigint`.
This returns two input boxes Min and Max for date filtering.
A full list of formatterParams for dates can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat).

```json
{
  "title": "Field",
  "field": "date_field",
  "headerFilter": "date",
  "formatter": "date",
  "formatterParams": {
    "options": {
      "year": "numeric",
      "month": "numeric",
      "day": "numeric"
    }
  }
}
```

### .toolbar{}

#### .clear_table_filters

Adds a toolbar button which will clear all current headerFilter.

```json
"toolbar": {
  "clear_table_filters": true
}
```

#### .download_csv{}

##### Tabulator Download

- The `.download_csv` can be set to a value of `true` which will just download the data using the built in Tabulator formatter on any Tabulator `dataview`.

```json
  "dataviews": {
          "table": {
            "display": true,
            "target": "tabview",
            "query": "query_dv",
            "toolbar": {
              "download_csv": true
            },
            "table": {
             "autoColumns":true,
             "columns":[]
             }
```

##### MAPP.Utils.csvDownload

- You can also specify a custom object for the download the data which will specify: the fields, the titles and the formats of these fields.

###### Optional Params

- `string: true` - Add this to a field to escape any value (this is required to prevent the download incorrectly breaking lines at commas if they exist in a field value).
- Header - To specify that the title of each field is used as the header column, pass a value of `true`, by default this is `false`.
- Separator - To specify the separator, by default this is a comma.
- Type - To specify the download type, by default this is UTF-8 CSV.
- Join - To specify the join, by default this is '\r\n'.
- Title - To specify the title, by default this is `file`.

```json
"download_csv": {
  "title": "DOWNLOAD_TITLE",
  "header": true,
  "fields": [
    {
      "field": "field_1",
      "title": "Field 1",
      "string": true
    },
    {
      "field": "field_2",
      "title": "Field 2"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Chart [dataview]

A Chart Dataview returns a table to the `tabview`. This uses the [ChartJS Package](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) to do so, please refer to the documentation for chart formatting options.

```json
   "Dataview Name": {
              "target": "tabview",
              "display": true,
              "query": "query_name",
              "queryparams": {
                "table": true,
                "filter": true
              },
      "chart": {
        "options": {
          "aspectRatio": 1.4,
          "indexAxis": "x"
        }
      }
    }
```

Here we can provide:

- `Dataview Name` - This generates a checkbox with the name provided in the Dataviews pane of the layer.
- `target: tabview` - This generates the dataview in the bar on the bottom of the MAPP window.
- `display: true`(optional) - This generates the dataview and but hides it from display. By default this is `false`.
- `queryparams` - This provides the parameters you wish to pass to a query.
  <br> You can provide `table: true` which will provide the table defined on the layer. This is especially useful when using a template but defining the table for each locale within the layer.json. <br> This requires the SQL query to contain `FROM ${table}` to ensure it only returns information from the relevant table location.
  <br> You can provide `filter: true` which will pass the filters selected on the layer to the query. This requires `WHERE true ${filter}` to be added to the query.
